  about: 'MOTI was founded in 2016 with the purpose of exploring “the image” in contemporary visual culture. In a time when a photograph is no longer just a photograph, an image is no longer just an image, a drawing is no longer just a drawing. A time when anything can be tagged with anything. A time when visual culture is the dominant language. Each month an artist is invited to curate the feature gallery with three hashtags. Any image tagged with these words will feed live into the gallery. The public is asked to filter through the images and save to the permanent collection.',
